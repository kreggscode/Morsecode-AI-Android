## 🎯 Final Fixes Applied

### 1. ✅ Encyclopedia Screen - FIXED
**Issue**: Huge empty space in category container  
**Solution**: Removed GlassCard wrapper, using simple Row instead

**Changes**:
```kotlin
// Before: GlassCard with padding causing huge space
GlassCard(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()) {
    Row(modifier = Modifier.padding(8.dp)) { ... }
}

// After: Simple Row with minimal padding
Row(
    modifier = Modifier
        .fillMaxWidth()
        .padding(horizontal = 4.dp)
) { ... }
```

**Result**: Category chips now compact, no wasted space! ✅
