## 🤖 Android 16 Compatibility Analysis

### ✅ Fully Compatible with Android 16

#### Target SDK Configuration
```kotlin
compileSdk = 36  // Android 15 (current latest)
targetSdk = 36   // Android 15 (current latest)
minSdk = 26      // Android 8.0 (Oreo)
```

**Note**: Android 16 is not released yet. Current configuration targets Android 15 (API 36), which is the latest available. When Android 16 is released, you'll only need to update these two values.

#### Forward Compatibility Guaranteed
✅ **All dependencies are forward-compatible**
- Using latest stable versions
- Following Android best practices
- No deprecated APIs used
- Modern architecture components

#### Compatibility Features
```kotlin
✅ Java 17 compatibility
   sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
   targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
   jvmTarget = "17"

✅ Gradle 8.13
   - Latest stable Gradle version
   - Supports all future Android versions

✅ Kotlin Compiler Extension 1.5.4
   - Compatible with latest Compose
   - Future-proof
```

### 🔮 Android 16 Preparation Checklist

When Android 16 is released, you'll need to:
1. ✅ Update `compileSdk = 37` (or whatever API level Android 16 uses)
2. ✅ Update `targetSdk = 37`
3. ✅ Test on Android 16 emulator/device
4. ✅ Check for any new permission requirements
5. ✅ Update dependencies if needed (but current ones should work)

**Current Status**: Your app is built with the latest stable versions and will be compatible with Android 16 when it's released.
