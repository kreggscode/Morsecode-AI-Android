# Comprehensive Fixes & New Features

## 🎯 All Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Light Mode Visibility - FIXED

**Solution**: 
- Added proper light theme colors throughout
- Background: Light blue gradients (#E3F2FD, #BBDEFF, #E1F5FE)
- Text: Dark blue colors (#1565C0, #0D47A1)
- Borders: Visible borders (#90CAF9, #2196F3)
- All components now have both dark and light theme support

### 2. ✅ Header Text Overlapping - FIXED
**Problem**: "Morse Translator" text overlapping with theme/settings icons
**Solution**:
- Added `modifier = Modifier.weight(1f)` to text column
- Proper spacing with `Arrangement.SpaceBetween`
- Reduced font size to 24sp for better fit
- Added proper padding (20dp all around)

- Real-time translation in both directions
- Clear visual indication of current mode

### 5. ✅ Play/Stop Toggle - IMPLEMENTED
**Problem**: No way to stop audio playback
**Solution**:

- `stopPlayback()` method in ViewModel
- Same for flashlight: "Flash/Stop" toggle
- State management with `isPlaying` and `isFlashing`

### 6. ✅ Flashlight Not Working - FIXED

**Solution**:
- Added `stopFlashlight()` method
- Proper state management with `isFlashing`
- Toggle button shows current state
- Visual feedback with gradient colors
- Neon glow effects on buttons

### 7. ✅ Encyclopedia Added - NEW FEATURE
