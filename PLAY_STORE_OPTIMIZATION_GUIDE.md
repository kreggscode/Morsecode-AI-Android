## 🎯 Google Play Console Warnings Fixed

### Warning 1: Native Debug Symbols ✅
**Issue**: "This App Bundle contains native code, and you've not uploaded debug symbols"

**Fixed**:
```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts - Line 33-35
buildTypes {
    release {
        ndk {
            debugSymbolLevel = "FULL"
        }
    }
}
```

**Result**: Debug symbols will now be automatically included in your AAB file ✅

---

### Warning 2: App Optimization ✅
**Issue**: "Enable app optimization for smaller and faster apps"

**Already Enabled**:
```kotlin
// app/build.gradle.kts - Line 26-27
release {
    isMinifyEnabled = true        // Code optimization ✅
    isShrinkResources = true      // Resource shrinking ✅
}
```

**Result**: Your app is already optimized! ✅

---

### Enhancement: Optimized Resource Shrinking ✅
**Added**: Advanced resource optimization for even smaller apps

**Configuration**:
```properties
# gradle.properties - Line 9
android.r8.optimizedResourceShrinking=true
```

**Result**: Maximum resource optimization enabled ✅

4. Rebuild: Build > Rebuild Project
```

### If App Crashes After Optimization:
```
1. Check ProGuard rules
2. Add keep rules for crashing classes
3. Test with debug build first
4. Review stack traces
```

### If Upload Fails:
