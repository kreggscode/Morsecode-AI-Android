Voice Input
Use voice recognition to speak naturally and see your words instantly converted to Morse code. This feature is perfect for hands-free operation and makes translation quick and convenient.

History Management
All your translations are automatically saved for future reference. You can search, filter, favorite important translations, and replay audio or flashlight signals for any saved entry.

Customization Options
Choose between light and dark themes, adjust audio frequency and playback speed, control flashlight brightness, and enable vibration feedback for Morse patterns.
