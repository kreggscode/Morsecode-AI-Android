## 🎯 Issues Fixed (From Screenshots)

### 1. ✅ History Screen - Text Visibility in Dark Mode
**Issue**: "No favorites yet" text was not visible in dark mode (Screenshot 1)

**Fix Applied**:
```kotlin
// File: HistoryScreen.kt - EmptyState function

Icon(
    tint = Color.White.copy(alpha = 0.6f)  // Was using theme color
)

Text(
    text = "No favorites yet",
    color = Color.White  // Was using theme color
)

Text(
    text = "Star translations to add them to favorites",
    color = Color.White.copy(alpha = 0.8f)  // Was using theme color
)
```

**Result**: All text now clearly visible in dark mode with white color

---

### 2. ✅ Encyclopedia Screen - Reduced Gap Below Category Chips
**Issue**: Huge gap below category filter chips (All, Letters, Numbers, Punctuation) - Screenshot 2

**Fix Applied**:
```kotlin
// File: EncyclopediaScreen.kt

// Category chips section
}

Spacer(modifier = Modifier.height(8.dp))  // Changed from 16.dp to 8.dp

// Entries List
LazyColumn(
```

**Result**: Gap reduced by 50% (16dp → 8dp), much more compact layout

---

### 3. ✅ History Auto-Save - Translations Now Saved Automatically
**Issue**: Translations were not being saved to history

**Fix Applied**:
```kotlin
// File: TranslatorScreenRevamped.kt - Translate button

GlassButton(
    text = "Translate",
    onClick = { 
        if (translationMode) {
            viewModel.onTextInputChanged(uiState.textInput)
        } else {
            viewModel.translateMorseToText(uiState.textInput)
        }
        viewModel.saveToHistory()  // ✅ ADDED THIS LINE
    },
)
```

**Result**: Every translation is now automatically saved to history with:
- Original text
- Morse code
- Timestamp
- Translation type (Text→Morse or Morse→Text)
- Delete option for each entry
- Favorite/unfavorite option
